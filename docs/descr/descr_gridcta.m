%% Description
% This is a MATLAB script that appears to be part of a larger workflow for processing and analyzing data from a scanner. Here's a high-level overview of the script:
% 
% 1. The script takes in several input parameters, including:
% 	* `scan`: a matrix representing the scanned data
% 	* `show`: a logical flag indicating whether to display a visual representation of the scan
% 	* `filename` and `extention`: strings specifying the output file name and extension
% 	* `delimiter` (optional): a character string specifying the delimiter used in the output file
% 2. The script performs several operations on the input data:
% 	* It applies a coordinate transformation to transform the scanned data into a more suitable format for further analysis.
% 	* If `show` is `true`, it displays a 3D scatter plot of the original scan, with optional offset and base markers added.
% 	* It writes the transformed data to an output file (if specified) in a matrix format.
% 3. The script also exports the following outputs:
% 	* `scan`: the original scanned data
% 	* `scanoffset`: the transformed coordinates of the scanned data
% 4. If the output file name includes an extension, it saves the `fitobj` structure to a separate file.
% 
% Some notable aspects of the script:
% 
% * It uses the `tiledlayout` function to create a 3D scatter plot with multiple axes.
% * It applies a coordinate transformation using functions like `prepareSurfaceData`, which is not shown in this snippet.
% * It uses MATLAB's built-in functions for plotting, such as `scatter3` and `xlabel`.
% * The script uses optional parameters and default values, making it more flexible and user-friendly.
% 
% To write a similar script from scratch, you would need to:
% 
% 1. Define the input parameters and their expected data types.
% 2. Perform the necessary coordinate transformation using your own functions or MATLAB's built-in functions.
% 3. Create a 3D scatter plot with multiple axes using `tiledlayout` and other plotting functions.
% 4. Write the transformed data to an output file in a matrix format.
% 5. Export the outputs, including any additional structures or values.
% 
% Keep in mind that this script is likely part of a larger workflow, so you may need to consult other scripts and documentation for more information on the specific requirements and assumptions made here.
